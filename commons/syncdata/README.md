This folder contains performance test scripts and test data of Syncdata module.

### Environment Required:-
***Below modules should be running in kubernetes setup***

* Kernel audit service
* Kernel authmanager service
* Kernel syncdata service
* Kernel keymanager service

### Data prequisite:-         
* App & Reference ID details are stored [here](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-performance-tests-mt/blob/1.1.5/commons/syncdata/support-files/App%26RefID.txt) and can be updated based on the environment.
* Machine details like name,publicKey,signPublicKey & keyIndex values are stored [here](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-performance-tests-mt/blob/1.1.5/commons/syncdata/support-files/machineDetails.csv) and can be updated based on the requirement.

### How to run JMeter scripts:-
* We need to take care of the prerequisites first for which we a helper script [Syncdata_Helper_Script.jmx](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-performance-tests-mt/blob/1.1.5/commons/syncdata/scripts/SyncData_Helper_Script.jmx).
* The helper script has one thread group for the creation of authorization token which we will further use in our execution.
* All the creation tasks which will happen that will automatically save the tokens created to a file in the bin folder of JMeter which will be used further by our test script for execution.
* For the test execution part we have a script [Syncdata_Test_Script.jmx](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-performance-tests-mt/blob/1.1.5/commons/syncdata/scripts/SyncData_Test_Script.jmx) which will do all the execution tasks.
* In the test script we have 7 execution thread groups for all the API's, where the main test execution will take place.
* The Syncdata module API's which we are considering here are - Public Key Verify API, Get Certificate API, Get User Details API, Get Client Settings API, Get Configs API, Get LatestID Schema API and Get CAcertificates API.
* All the thread groups will run in a sequential manner & if we don't want to run all of them we can disable the one which we don't want to run.
* Also for viewing the results or output of our test we have added certain listener test elements at the end of our test script which are - View Results Tree, Aggregate Report, Active Threads Over Time graph, Response Times Percentiles graph, Response Times vs Threads graph & Transaction Throughput vs Threads graph.
* We have a test element named 'User Defined Variables' in both the helper & test scripts where the server IP, server port, protocol, clientId, secretKey & appId all these are parameterized & can be changed based on our requirements which will further reflect in the entire script.
